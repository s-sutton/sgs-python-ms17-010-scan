# sgs-python-ms17-010-scan
Untested Python version of the MetaSploit Microsoft Windows SMB Remote Execution Scanner

<h1>DO NOT USE</h1>

This is a side project that I'm doing to orient myself in coding exploits in Python. It might not even work as a functional script and I might never finish it.

The general principles behind the script are based on [this MetaSploit script](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41891), which I recommend instead. This Python script is not meant to be a full one-to-one adaptation of this script, but is instead a Python script that can scan for the same vulnerability in a similar/identical way. Hypothetically, at least.
